            I am a student at Clarkson University studying Communications, Media, and Design with a minor in Digital Arts. I'm passionate about music, digital art, and creative-concept design in general. My proficiencies span a variety of creative design and technical software, including:

            Are you working on a creative project and need someone to fill in any role that may utilize these programs? I'm your guy. I'm willing to contribute to any kind of project, whether it is a video game design project, writing, website or logo design, video production and editing, or anything else you may need my help for.

            I am currently practicing front-end web development in CSS and HTML but my technical skills cover more than just front-end web development. As shown in the first figure above, I choose to ulilize adobe XD to create and design web layouts before I code them through CSS and HTML. This allows me to create a working layout before committing to the technical aspects of it. In this example, I redesigned a mobile app for Potsdam's local movie theater. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As seen in the middle figure, I've had practice creating and rigging models in Maya 2022. I can design a variety of models for animation or game design projects. My style consists of a more cartoony and exaggerated look, with an emphasis on brighter colors. This could work for retro-game-themed projects or 3D cartoons. I am able and willing to design more realistic models if needed as well.

            Among my list of credentials is my ability to work with cameras. I currently own a Canon Rebel t6i and am proficient in using it. I am an able photographer and video producer. The above examples are video projects I have produced for previous classes. I tend to go for more absurdist concepts when coming up with ideas for my projects. I take pride in my sense of humor and out-of-the-box design concepts. I can take any role in a video project I might be needed for. I can film, edit, and act in video projects. My acting shines most in over-the-top, comedy centric scenarios. As displayed in the above figures, I often make use of abrupt cuts in the footage and abnormally long pauses in some cases to create tention and comedic value but, as shown in the center video, a fan-made music video of 'Engravings" by Ethan Bortnick, I can utliize traditional editing methods when needed as well.
